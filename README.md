[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Polymer/polymer-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Polymer/polymer-starter-kit)


Web components provide reusable and dynamic interface elements for your EOS DApps. For example if you wanted to allow users to create an accocunt that can be locked and unlocked, save and restore a backup file, create mutiple identities each with their own name, EOS Keypair and Avater image, or let's say you want to allow the users of your DApp to print a paper wallet, with EOS Blox, it's as simple as using a familiar html tag like

    <eos-account id="eos-account"></eos-account>

All the encryption and acocunt objects are contained within the web component, leaving you to focus on the UX/UI of your next amazing EOS DApp.

If you are a bit more advanced and you want to use a touch of JavaScript and you have used somthing like JQuery then picking up webcomoponents will be a breeze, you can call functions like

    this.$.eos-account.createAccount(password, username)


Webcomponents in a nutshell:

* **Push** components required for the initial route
* **Render** initial route ASAP
* **Pre-cache** components for remaining routes
* **Lazy-load** and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

Install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli@next

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init polymer-3-starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    npm start

### Build

The `npm run build` command builds your Polymer application for production, using build configuration options provided by the command line or in your project's `polymer.json` file.

You can configure your `polymer.json` file to create multiple builds. This is necessary if you will be serving different builds optimized for different browsers. You can define your own named builds, or use presets. See the documentation on [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production) for more information.

The Polymer Starter Kit is configured to create three builds. These builds will be output to a subdirectory under the `build/` directory as follows:

```
build/
  es5-bundled/
  es6-bundled/
  esm-bundled/
```

* `es5-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is compiled to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.
* `es6-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that can handle ES6 code - see [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production#compiling) for a list.
* `esm-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. It uses standard ES module import/export statements for browsers that support them.

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production).

### Preview the build

This command serves your app. Replace `build-folder-name` with the folder name of the build you want to serve.

    npm start build/build-folder-name/

### Run tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    npm test

If running Windows you will need to set the following environment variables:

- LAUNCHPAD_BROWSERS
- LAUNCHPAD_CHROME
